# High Ping Kicker
Inspired by SourceMod plugins [Very Basic High Ping Kicker](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=769939) and [High Ping Kicker](https://github.com/ZK-Servidores/High-Ping-Kicker)

## Installation
1. Install [CounterStrike Sharp](https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp) and [Metamod:Source](https://www.sourcemm.net/downloads.php/?branch=master).

2. Download [HighPingKicker.zip](https://github.com/wiruwiru/HighPingKicker-CS2/releases) from the releases section.

3. Unzip the archive and upload it to the game server.

4. Start the server and wait for the configuration file to be generated.

5. Edit the configuration file with the parameters of your choice.

## Configuration Example
When the plugin is first loaded, the following config will be generated in `counterstrikesharp/configs/plugins/HighPingKicker/HighPingKicker.json`

```json
{
   "max_ping": 150,
   "max_warnings": 5,
   "check_interval": 20,
   "show_warnings": true,
   "show_public_kick_message": true,
   "warning_message": "You will be kicked for excessive ping. You have {WARN} out of {MAXWARN} warnings.",
   "kick_message": "{NAME} has been kicked due to excessive ping.",
   "grace_period_seconds": 90,
   "whitelist": [],
   "EnableDebug": false,
   "ConfigVersion": 2,
}
```

## Whitelist Configuration
The whitelist allows you to exclude specific players from being kicked for high ping. Add SteamID64 values to the whitelist array:

```json
{
   "whitelist": [
      "76561199000000000",
      "76561299000000000",
      "76561399000000000"
   ]
}
```

### How to get SteamID64
1. Go to [SteamID.xyz](https://steamid.xyz/)
2. Enter the player's Steam profile URL or Steam username
3. Copy the SteamID64 value (17-digit number starting with 765611...)
